# EXERCISE 1 for EC530
## By: Yongjoon Kweon

In this exercise, I created an exercise.py file that contains my functions that calculate the distance between two geographical coordinates. I also created a function that will match each coordinate in the first array to the coordinate with the smallest distance in the second array.

I matched each coordinate with another coordinate that it was closest to. I also created a scripting file that would test my outputs. I first tested my distance function, then I tested my matching function next. 

To test the code, you must following steps:
- input a test case into my pytest file named "test_exercise.py"
    - you may want to comment out my test cases right now
- Be sure that your csv file contains keywords "latitude, lat" or "longitude, long, lng"
