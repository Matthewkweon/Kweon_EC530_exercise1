# EXERCISE 1 for EC530
## By: Yongjoon Kweon

In this exercise, I created an exercise.py file that contains my functions that calculate the distance between two geographical coordinates. I also created a function that will match each coordinate in the first array to the coordinate with the smallest distance in the second array.

I matched each coordinate with another coordinate that it was closest to. I also created a scripting file that would test my outputs. I first tested my distance function, then I tested my matching function next.
